# Signature_Verification__Using_Saimese_Network

✍️ Signature Verification using Siamese NetworksThis repository contains an implementation of a Siamese Network model for online/offline signature verification. The project uses the powerful feature extraction capabilities of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to generate high-dimensional embeddings for signatures. The system then determines the authenticity of a signature by calculating the distance between the reference sample and the verification sample, providing a similarity score via a Gradio web interface.🚀 Project OverviewSignature verification is a classic application of biometric authentication. This project addresses the task as a one-shot learning problem, meaning the model can learn to compare two instances (signatures) even if it has seen only one or a few examples during training.The core technology used is the Siamese Network.ShutterstockThis architecture is defined by having two or more identical subnetworks (referred to as 'twins') which share identical weights.Feature Extraction: Each subnetwork processes one input signature and outputs a compact, 256-dimensional embedding vector, typically the output of a final dense layer in the backbone CNN.Distance Calculation: The distance between the two embedding vectors is calculated (using the L1 distance metric, which represents the element-wise absolute difference).Similarity Score: This distance is passed through a final layer (with a Sigmoid activation) to produce a similarity score between 0 and 1.Verification: If the similarity score exceeds a defined threshold (set to 55% in the current Gradio demo), the signature is classified as Verified (Match). (A low threshold prioritizes usability by minimizing false rejections of genuine signatures).🛠️ Key TechnologiesDeep Learning Framework: TensorFlow and KerasModel Architecture: Custom Siamese Network utilizing specialized layers (L1Distance, L2Normalization).Application Interface: Gradio for creating a simple, shareable, browser-based demo.Data Handling: NumPy, PIL (Pillow).📈 Performance MetricsThe model demonstrates strong classification capabilities, exhibiting high accuracy on both the training and independent testing datasets.MetricAccuracy ScoreTraining Accuracy92%Testing Accuracy97%Verification Threshold (EER Proxy)55%📂 Repository StructureThe core files for the application and model are:FileDescriptionapp.pyPython script containing the Gradio interface, model loading logic, preprocessing, and the predict_match function.siamese_signature.kerasThe trained model file required by app.py.

cd signature-verification-siamese
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow gradio


🚀 Usage (Running the Demo)Once you have installed the prerequisites and ensured siamese_signature.keras is in the same directory as app.py:Run the application script:python app.py


Gradio will launch a local server and provide a URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860). If running in a Colab or hosted notebook environment, it will generate a public share link.Test the System:Upload a Reference Sample (Image 1) of a known signature.Upload a Verification Sample (Image 2) to be checked against the reference.The system will display the Similarity Score (e.g., 78.50%) and the Verification Result (Match or No Match).🎥 Demo Video (Gradio Interface)The best way to showcase the interactive application is through a short video demonstration.$$INSERT LINK TO YOUR GRADIO DEMO VIDEO HERE$$This video should walk viewers through:Loading the application.Uploading two similar (Genuine) signatures and showing the "Match" result.Uploading two dissimilar (Forged) signatures and showing the "No Match" result.Mentioning the current verification threshold of 55%.🤝 ContributionFeel free to open issues or submit pull requests to improve the model architecture, training pipeline, or the Gradio interface.Created by$$Your Name/GitHub Handle$$
